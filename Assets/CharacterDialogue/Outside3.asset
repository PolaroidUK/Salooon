    text: Sheriff, listen up! The grapevine is buzzin' louder than a rattlesnake.
      You want to know about that poker game? Start by eavesdropping on the gossip
      around here. Head to the bar, mix up a few drinks, and watch those secrets
      pour out. And keep an eye out for that chatty chicken! Oh, and word is, the
      rabbit bartender is allergic to carrots, so tread lightly, partner!

    text: Well, reckon a quick ride to the Saloon won't hurt. A sheriff's duty, after
      all. And who knows, maybe Fred's right. A bit of spicy gossip might make my
      departure legendary!
